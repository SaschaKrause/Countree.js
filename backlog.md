# Backlog | Todos

### Bugs
- __#BUG-1__ 'notifyAt' seems to be buggy: when counting down the 'beforeEnd' event won't fire (when counting up, the 'afterStart' seems broken)
- __#BUG-2__ when not displaying the milliseconds to the user, it seems like a bug (to him) that a second is "missing" (because of rounding issues)

### Tasks
- __#TASK-1__ improve error handling strategy (and convenience methods!) for public methods
- __#TASK-2__ add some Jasmine tests
- __#TASK-3__ use a templating framework (e.g. handlebars) to demonstrate the power of the CountResult.formattedTime()

### Features
- __#FEATURE-1__ be able to add the config after instantiation (e.g. setOptions(options))
- __#FEATURE-2__ get progress in % (e.g. 13% are already counted down/up)
- __#FEATURE-3__ provide option: CONTINUE_AFTER_FINISH and STOP_AFTER_FINISH (e.g. when counting from 10, should the counter stop at 0, or should it go further [e.g. to -100])
- __#FEATURE-4__ provide the possibility to not just only count the time, but also other numeric stuff (e.g. count +1 every time one hits a button)
- __#FEATURE-5__ provide the possibility count down or up to a specific date
